This project involves a calculator developed in Python Language.
It is being made with the help of Tkinter Module which helps us to create GUI Applications and do operations with the help of them.
We can do simple operations like Addition , Subtraction , Multiplication and Division on numbers.
We can also use decimal numbers in this calculator.
There is also a 'C' button to clear the space where the calculations are done.
Hope you find this project good!
