## This project involves a calculator developed in Python Language using Tkinter Library.
__It is being made with the help of Tkinter Module which helps us to create GUI Applications and do operations with the help of them.__

We can do simple operations like:-
* Addition 
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division

We can also use __decimal numbers__ in this calculator.

There is also a __'C'__ button to clear the space where the calculations are done.
Hope you find this project good!üòÅ
